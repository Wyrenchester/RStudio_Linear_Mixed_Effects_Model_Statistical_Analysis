Linear Mixed Effects Model in the Context of Nucleopore Diameter Measurements

This is done as part of my research work at Emory University. The original dataset is not provided, but contained approximately 3000+ data points. 

In this study, we are measuring the diameter (in nanometers) of nucleopores within nuclei after analysis of super-resolution microscopy images.
We imaged multiple cells in a number of experiments, with multple experimental conditions. Because measurements are repeated within nuclei, within cells, and across experimental conditions, 
the data are hierarchically structured and not independent. Thus, we utilized a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LME) to analyze data.
